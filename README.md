# A Python-Based Open-Source Tool for Solar Energy Site Selection

Welcome to the project! This repository contains a Python-based open-source tool that simplifies and democratizes the complex process of solar site selection. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, catering to a wide range of use-cases.

## Overview

It is a tool developed to streamline the process of solar energy site selection. The site selection process often involves considering a multitude of variables, such as geographical location, types of terrain, sunlight availability, and existing local infrastructure, among other factors. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries and user-friendly syntax, it is able to accommodate users with varying levels of technical expertise.

The project leverages Python's open-source libraries for geospatial analysis and decision-making, providing a comprehensive, flexible, and user-friendly solution for solar energy site selection.

## Research Gap
Despite the growing reliance on GIS and MCDA methods for solar site selection, there is a distinct gap in the availability of tools that allow for the integration of different site selection methods and are also accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. This research aims to address this gap by developing an open-source Python tool, capable of integrating different site selection methodologies within a single pipeline.
This tool will leverage the power and flexibility of Python to provide a highly customizable and user-friendly solution for solar site selection. Pythonâ€™s open-source libraries for geospatial analysis and decision-making, such as Geopandas, Rasterio, PyCDA, and SciKit-Learn, will form the backbone of this tool. These libraries offer a wealth of functionalities that can be integrated into the tool's pipeline, allowing it to adapt to the evolving needs and technologies in the field of solar energy site selection (Millington and Jupp, 2017).

The proposed Python tool offers a promising solution to the current limitations and research gaps, by combining the advantages of open-source software with the ability to integrate various site selection methods. Through this approach, it aims to deliver a robust, flexible, and user-friendly tool for solar energy site selection.
